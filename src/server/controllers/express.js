  // Create a session middleware with the given options
  // Note session data is not saved in the cookie itself, just the session ID. Session data is stored server-side.
  // Options: resave: forces the session to be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never
  //                  modified during the request. Depending on your store this may be necessary, but it can also
  //                  create race conditions where a client has two parallel requests to your server and changes made
  //                  to the session in one request may get overwritten when the other request ends, even if it made no
  //                  changes(this behavior also depends on what store you're using).
  //          saveUnitialized: Forces a session that is uninitialized to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when
  //                  it is new but not modified. Choosing false is useful for implementing login sessions, reducing server storage
  //                  usage, or complying with laws that require permission before setting a cookie. Choosing false will also help with
  //                  race conditions where a client makes multiple parallel requests without a session
  //          secret: This is the secret used to sign the session ID cookie.
  //          name: The name of the session ID cookie to set in the response (and read from in the request).
  //          cookie: Please note that secure: true is a recommended option.
  //                  However, it requires an https-enabled website, i.e., HTTPS is necessary for secure cookies.
  //                  If secure is set, and you access your site over HTTP, the cookie will not be set.
